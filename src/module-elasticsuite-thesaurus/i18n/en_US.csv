"Maximum number of thesaurus rules applied at a given time to a given search query to produce alternative queries. That number applies first to the synonyms rules and then the expansion rules. For instance if the setting's value is 2, it means each alternative query will be the result of the application of at most 2 synonyms rules and at most 2 expansion rules. But if you have 10 synonym rules and 5 expansion rules, they could all end up being applied by pairs. So be careful about augmenting this setting's value, especially if you already have a lot of rules with long lists of alternative terms.","Maximum number of thesaurus rules applied at a given time to a given search query to produce alternative queries.
