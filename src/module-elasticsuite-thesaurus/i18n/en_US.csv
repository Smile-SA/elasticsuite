"Maximum number of thesaurus rules applied at a given time to a given search query to produce alternative queries. That number applies first to the synonyms rules and then the expansion rules. For instance if the setting's value is 2, it means each alternative query will be the result of the application of at most 2 synonyms rules and at most 2 expansion rules. But if you have 10 synonym rules and 5 expansion rules, they could all end up being applied by pairs. So be careful about augmenting this setting's value, especially if you already have a lot of rules with long lists of alternative terms.","Maximum number of thesaurus rules applied at a given time to a given search query to produce alternative queries.

"If enabled, by applying the same stemming behavior that occurs when indexing product data, this will allow search queries to match synonym and expansion rules more broadly with regard to singular and plural forms of words. For instance, for a synonym rule ""story,tale"", searching either for ""story"" <strong>or ""stories""</strong> will trigger the synonym and make Elasticsuite also search for ""tale"". For an expansion rule ""sport => football,tennis,soccer,running"", searching either for ""sport"" <strong>or ""sports""</strong> will trigger the expansion and make Elasticsuite also search for ""football"", ""tennis"", ""soccer"" and ""running"".<br />If disabled, the legacy stricter matching mode will be applied, where searching for ""stor<strong>ies</strong>"" would <strong>not</strong> trigger a ""story,tale"" synonym or searching for ""sport<strong>s</strong>"" would not trigger a ""sport => football,tennis,soccer,running"" expansion.","If enabled, by applying the same stemming behavior that occurs when indexing product data, this will allow search queries to match synonym and expansion rules more broadly with regard to singular and plural forms of words.
