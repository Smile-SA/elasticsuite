"scale function desc","Attribute value based optimizers can easily overshadow constant score ones. You can limit the boost impact by reducing the initial range of raw source values to keep the spread of applied boosts to something reasonable, both between products impacted by this optimizer and with regard to products only boosted by other optimizers."
"log1p desc","Very aggressively reduces the spread of boost values by retaining the power of ten of the attribute value (using the common logarithm), so a product with a value of 100 will be boosted by a factor of 2, a product with a value of 1000 will be boosted by a factor of 3, a product with a value of 10000 will be boosted by a factor of 4."
"sqrt desc","Aggressively reduces the spread of the boost attribute values by applying the square root function : a product with a value of 10 will be boosted by a factor of around 3, a product with a value of 100 will be boosted by a factor of 10, a product with a value of 1000 will be boosted by a factor of around 30, a product with a value of 10000 will be boosted by a factor of 100."
"none desc","No change to the spread of boost attributes values which are taken as is, so a product with an attribute value of 1000 will be boosted 200 times more than a product with an attribute value of 5. This function is best suited for values that do not have a very wide range."
