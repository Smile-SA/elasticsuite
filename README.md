## News

### ⚠️ Magento versions compatibility :

We had a lot of work on Magento 2.1.x compatibility since there was a lot of compatibility breaking changes in this version (introduction of the entity manager, new form based on UI components, staging for the EE edition, ...).

The migration is now finished concerning **both CE and EE versions**.

If your project is based on Magento 2.1.x you can start working with ElasticSuite today using the latest **2.3.0 release**.

**Which version should I use ?**

## Main Features

### Current version

The current version **2.3.0** has been focused on the **Search Optimizers** feature and on various performances improvements.

Feel free to read the whole changelog of this version [here](https://github.com/Smile-SA/elasticsuite/releases/tag/2.3.0)

This version also features a full **Staging Compatibility** and can be used without issues on Magento Enterprise Edition 2.1.x.

From now, we are still working on the migration of all features available into the Magento 1.x .version of the module in this new version.

Actually, there are the features actually included :

<br/>

* **Virtual categories :**

    ElasticSuite allows you to **define categories based on rules** (in addition to the standard manual selection). The rule definition is based on the Magento rules components, so you will not be disoriented.
    You are able to define categories such as "All products for men that are currently discounted".

    The engine will automatically refresh products matching the selection in Front-Office and will prevent you from having to re-assign products manually.

    ![Virtual Categories](doc/static/virtual_category.png)

    A dynamic preview of the results in the Back-Office is also included for more convenience.

<br/>

* **Search optimizations :**

    ElasticSuite also features several ways to **optimize the search engine relevance**. This part is again based on rules that can be defined in the Magento's back-office.

    This allows you to create rules like "Boost all products that are in stock", "Boost all new products", "Boost men products", etc ...

    ![Search Optimizers](doc/static/search_optimizers.png)

    On the next version, a preview for all optimizer rules will be available in the back-office so that you will be able to **preview each fine-tuning before publishing it**.

* **Categories Merchandising :**

    A new **Merchandising** panel has been added into the category edition screen of Magento's Back-Office. It features a **direct preview** of the current product list according to category settings.

    Inside this panel, you are also able to use a **drag-and-drop interface** to apply custom sort order on some of the category products.

    This feature is compatible with "standard" categories but also with the Virtual Categories described before.

<br/>

* **Products, Categories & Attributes autocomplete  :**

    ElasticSuite features **enhanced content in the autocomplete box** : popular search terms, **products and categories**, and also **attributes**.

    The autocomplete is **fully extensible to add custom content**, such as shop pages (if your store uses a store locator), CMS pages, etc...

    You can see the [wiki page](https://github.com/Smile-SA/elasticsuite/wiki) about adding custom content into the autocomplete results.

<br/>

* **Enhanced thesaurus management :**

    Thesaurus are now managed directly by the engine instead of the legacy Magento's behavior.

    Our module allows you to add complete thesauri in the Magento Back-Office. Actually, the module supports **two types of thesauri** :

    - Synonyms : standard synonym feature, let you contribute a list of terms which are synonyms of each others.

    ![Synonyms](doc/static/synonyms.png)

    This means that adding a synonym between *"men"* and *"man"* will make it working in all queries containing *"men"* like *"men shirt"* or *"men pants"* instead of having to define a synonym for each query.

    - Expansions : this kind of thesaurus allows to expand all search for a given term to an other list of terms.

    ![Expansions](doc/static/expansions.png)

    This means that adding an expansion between *"sport"* and *"fitness, gym, running"* will make it expanding for all queries containing *"sport"* like *"sport shoes"* (which would be expanded to "fitness shoes", "gym shoes", and "running shoes").

<br/>

* **Enhanced price slider :**

    The module features an **out of the box price slider**.

    ![Price Slider](doc/static/price_slider.png)

<br/>

* **Multiple select in layered navigation :**

    The module allows customers to **apply multiple values of the same filter** criteria.

    ![Multi Select Facet](doc/static/multiselect_facet.png)

<br/>

* **Multiple select for swatches :**

    Same as above, the module allow the users to **choose several swatches** for filtering.

    ![Multi Select Swatches](doc/static/multiselect_swatches.png)

<br/>

* **Redirect on one result :**

    The module allow to redirect to the product page when a full text search matches only one product.

    ![Redirect One Result](doc/static/redirect_one_result.png)

<br/>

* **Approaching search and spellchecking :**

    The module **automatically detects typing mistakes** and handles correct results for them. Don't worry about "fat-finger syndrome" anymore !

    ![Approaching Search](doc/static/approaching_search.png)

<br/>

* **Automatic stopwords detection :**

    The module is able to **automatically detect "stopwords"** based on their frequency into the search index.
    This means the engine is able to deal with queries containing stopwords, but also with **pure stopwords queries** such as "to be or not to be" or even "he and she"!

<br/>

* **Fully Configurable relevance configuration :**

    You are able to customize - on your own, via a dedicated screen in Magento's back-office - each technical parameters that are used to communicate with ElasticSearch.
    Doig so, you can **fine-tune the engine's configuration** to fit your needs according to your store's data typology.

<br/>

* **Customizable filters :**

    Each attribute can now be configured in Magento's back-office to **change its behavior when used for filtering**

   -  Conditional display of the filter based on its coverage rate.
   -  Maximum number of elements displayed by the filter.
   -  Sort order of elements of the filter.

### And more to come !

The next versions that will be coming all among this year will include the following features :

* **Behavioral Search optimizations :**

    Second part of the relevance optimization features will be the behavioral optimizers. This will allow you to build **rules matching your customer's behavior**.
    Thanks to this feature, optimization rules like "Apply a boost for most viewed products" or "Boost the top sales products" are now possible to create.

* **Recommendations engine :**

    On top of the behavioral analysis part will come our recommendations engine. It will allow you to propose **custom recommendations to your customers, based on their previous visits on your websites**, and on other customer behaviors.

    Planned recommendations features are :
     + "Customers also bought"
     + Similar products
     + Cross Selling
     + Per-user recommendations, based on current customer profile and its previous visits and orders.
